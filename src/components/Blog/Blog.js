                <h2>Q : Difference Between State vs Prop?</h2>
                <p>A : Props are used to pass data from one component to another. The state is a local data storage that is local to the component only and cannot be passed to other components. The this. setState property is used to update the state values in the component. Props are Immutable. Although a component is not allowed to change its props, it is responsible for the props of its child components down the component tree. On the other hand, state is mutable. A stateful component changes its state every time users interact with the app.</p>
